Voice is the first native text-to-speech app for Ubuntu Touch. It supports over 20 languages and different speech speeds.

Voice requires your own free API-Key from [VoiceRSS.org](http://www.voicerss.org) and an active internet connection.

**Help, I don't hear anything!**
Are you sure that you've turned up the volume? Test this by typing some long string in the text field. Then click on 'Speech Text'. Immediately press the volume up button.
If it's still not working, make sure that you have an active internet connection and a working API-Key.

If you are on an Ubuntu Touch device you can click [here](scope://com.canonical.scopes.clickstore?q=VoiceBySander) to install Voice.
